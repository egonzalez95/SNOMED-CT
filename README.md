# SNOMED-CT
This code analyzes datasets from SNOMED-CT, the most comprehensive and multilingual clinical terminology in the world. It helps improve the quality of the database with lexical and symmetrical approaches.

## Purpose
This code analyzes datasets from SNOMED-CT, the most comprehensive and multilingual clinical terminology in the world. Used in over 5000 organizations worldwide, it is vital that the quality of data is at its best. This program lexically and recursively scans data sets for inconsistencies and suggests appropriate fixes - regardless of language. Snoflake-API is used to facilitate speeds when processing data from SNOMED-CT. This was part of a research project for the National Science Foundation and LSAMP. Please note this was my first programming project and many methods used do not reflect what I now know.
